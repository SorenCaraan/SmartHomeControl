# Smart Home Control Project

***Please Read Copyright Disclaimers***

This objective of this Assignment is to build a Smart Home Controller. A set of predefined
Java code is given, in this project the predefined will be finished along with additional code

## Project Description:

In this assignment you will work on developing a Smart Home controller. The Controller
receives data and notifications from several sensors spread around a building, and based on
these it controls several actuators, i.e., devices that change the state of the house. A major
challenge is integrating various devices from different vendors so that they all work together
with the controller. 

Specifically, a consortium of smart home vendors, called "ITEC3030 Smart
Home Consortium‚Äù worked together to produce the Simple Smart Device Collaboration Standard
(SSDCS) in form of a set of Java Interfaces
